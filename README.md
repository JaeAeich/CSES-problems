# CSES Problem Set :books:

Welcome to my repository for the CSES problem set :smiley:, a collection of problems and solutions for learning algorithms and data structures, this repo is filled with 
all the problems I have solved till with well commented and explained with resources if need be, I will keep on updating the repo as I go on and so stay tune.

## Problems :pencil:

The CSES problem set includes a wide range of problems :bulb:, covering topics such as:
- Basic algorithms and data structures :guardsman:
- Sorting and searching :mag:
- Dynamic programming :runner:
- Graph algorithms :city_sunset:
- Greedy algorithms :moneybag:
- Advanced algorithms and topics :mortar_board:

## Solutions :computer:

The solutions in this repository are written in C++ (I plan to include other languages too :smile:) and are organized by problem number. Each solution includes detailed comments to explain the reasoning and thought process behind the implementation.

## Contributing :handshake:

This repository is open for contributions. If you have a better solution or find a bug in my code, feel free to create a pull request. If you have any suggestions for improving the repository, please open an issue.

## Acknowledgments :clap:

I would like to thank the CSES problem set for providing a valuable resource for learning algorithms and data structures.
